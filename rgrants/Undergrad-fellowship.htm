        <h2>Undergraduate Research Fellowship</h2>
        <h3>Spring 2009 Call for Applications</h3>
        <div id="content2">
          <p>This program  pairs promising undergraduate students with a faculty or instructor mentor in  order to prepare students to pursue a graduate education. The fellowship offers  these students the opportunity to network with C/LRC faculty and graduate  student affiliates, as well as provide a mentor for students as they navigate  the graduate school application process. Undergraduate students participating  in the URF will learn to articulate research questions, conduct research  independently, and organize their findings in a scholarly way. Faculty and  graduate student participants will provide training for these students as well  as acquire help with their own research project. We are particularly interested  in collaborating with students from underrepresented groups, as well as with  students whose research interests include critical analyses of gender,  education, (im)migration, border studies, Native American Studies, and  Chicana/o Studies, among other fields.</p>
          <p>Undergraduate  fellows will work with a faculty member who shares similar research interests.  As part of their fellowship, students will work 40-50 hours throughout the  quarter on the faculty member’s research and will receive a one-time stipend of  up to $500. The tasks could include library research, writing summaries of  readings, photocopying, organizing materials, and/or creating  annotated bibliographies. It is the responsibility of the faculty participant  and the student to determine the precise nature of the research work.<strong> </strong></p>
          <p>Faculty  participants will also be asked to provide professional guidance and advice  regarding the specific responsibilities and opportunities in their respective  fields as well as the process of selecting and applying to graduate school. The  faculty member will enhance the student’s likelihood of future academic success  by sharing specific research skills, such as how to frame a project, how to  read documents/texts critically and effectively, how to write grant proposals,  and/or how to navigate the IRB review process. Fellows will thus benefit from a  close-working relationship with a faculty member, gain skills necessary for  success in graduate school, and participate in a course designed to demystify  the graduate school application process. </p>
          <p>Students  registered in the Spring 2009 quarter for CHI 198, a new two-credit course for  those applying to graduate school, are eligible to apply for the UC Davis  Chicana/Latina Research Center’s <strong>Undergraduate  Research Fellowship (URF).</strong></p>
