       	 Evelyn Boria-Rivera is the current C/LRC dissertation fellow. She is a Ph.D Candidate in the English Department and Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame. Her dissertation considers the role of literary representations of the maternal in the development of late XX century American literature by Latinas Boria-Rivera's project seeks to understand why important histories of maternal repression are almost absent from literary texts that often try to recover and retell the history of major waves of Latin American immigration to the US at the period of the Cold War.

In her book, Arredondo offers a  new reading of Mexican experiences in Chicago by arguing that rather than  merely seeking to assimilate to the environment along with various other  groups, Mexicans forged new identities based on revolutionary Mexico which also  distinguished them from their Polish, Italian, Irish and African-American  neighbors. Her interpretation challenges assumptions about what constitutes an  “American” and depart from static constructions of assimilation.<br>
          </p>
       	  <p>An associate professor of Latin American and Latino  Studies at UC Santa Cruz, Dr. Arredondo has authored and co-edited various  texts relating to Mexicans in Chicago as well as Chicana feminisms. Most  recently, her essay “Of Breasts<u><img src="/news/media/aredondo's book.jpg" alt="arredondo's book" width="114" height="170" align="right" class="rightalign"></u> and Baldness: My Life with Cancer” appeared in  last year’s volume <u>Speaking From the Body: Latinas on Health and Culture</u>,  edited by Professors Angie Chabram-Dernersesian and Adela de la Torre, both  faculty members of UCD’s Chicana/o Studies Program. <br>
          </p>
       	  <p>Dr. Arredondo’s research interests are wide-ranging and  include: Latina/o Studies; U.S. immigration history; U.S. social and cultural  history; Chicana/o History; critical race and ethnicity theories; Chicana and  Mexicana feminisms, borderlands studies, and the history of modern Mexico. </p>
