       	  <p><strong><img src="/news/media/Discursive practices.jpg" alt="discursive-practices" width="224" height="219" hspace="4" vspace="2" align="left">Discursive Practices: The formation of a Transnational Indigenous Poetics</strong></p>
       	  <p><br>
       	    The conference brought together scholars and writers from U.S., Canada,  Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru that engage and/or produce  indigenous literary creations. The organizers hoped to dismiss the conventional  idea that the indigenous experience needs mediation. </p>
       	  <p>The  conference was particularly important because it is one of the few occasions  that brings together indigenous writers from the North and South. The format  allowed for the establishment of an open and productive dialogue between  writers of different ethnicities about issues fundamental to their intellectual  and creative production. <br>
   	      </p>
       	  <p>The Conference had a “formal” academic aspect in which some participants were  asked to present orally<img src="/news/media/discursive practice1.jpg" alt="discursivepractes1" width="199" height="274" align="right"> a written paper for 20 minutes in panels/sessions,  after which the audience could ask questions. The less formal aspect of our  Conference was originated from the round tables that brought together  participants in creative areas—poetry, fiction, essays, theater and other stage  performances—and in very free form with less time limits enabling participants  to offer their creative and intellectual experiences and ideas to other  participants and the rest of the audience. Throughout the conference the  participants could establish a deep trust, understanding, mutual respect, and,  above all, an efficient level of linguistic communication in spite of lacking  simultaneous translation services. </p>
       	  <p>The conference had the participation of numerous  professional women from the Americas who are engaged in indigenous literature:</p>
