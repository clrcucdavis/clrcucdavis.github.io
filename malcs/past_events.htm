          <p><strong>MALCS: Beyond the Bachelor's Degree </strong>          </p>
          <p><img src="/malcs/media/Beyond the Bachelors Degree Flyer.jpg" alt="beyond the B." width="233" height="151" hspace="3" border="2" align="left">As part of La Raza  Cultural Days week (LRCD), on Wednesday, April 29th, MALCS UCD  chapter hosted a graduate school panel of Chicanas and Latinas who varied  generationally in their academic career. This event focused on improving the  educational pipeline for  Chicana/o and Latina/o since only .02% of Chicana/os and Latina/os reach  graduate school. Through personal testimonials and advice the four panelists  were able to inspire the attendees who had a brief insight to graduate school. <br>
The four panelists  were Dr. Angie Chabram-Dernersesian, Professor in the Chicana/o Studies  Department, Evelyn Boria-Rivera, Chicana/Latina Research Center’s dissertation  fellow for 2008-2009 year and PhD candidate in English at Notre Dame University,  Isabel Porras, UCD graduate student in the Cultural Studies Group, and Monica  Pombo, recently admitted into the Pharmacology and Toxicology Program at UCD. Each  of the panelists shared their experience applying for graduate school and later  being a graduate student. The panelists were in different levels of academia so  the attendees had different examples and perspectives on graduate education. <br>
Dr.  Chambram-Dernesesian, recounted her experience being the first generation in  her family to go to college and obtain a doctoral degree. She also explained  how her goals have changed and how now she is working to improve the  educational pipeline. After many years of being part of the Chicana/o studies  program, now, once the program has become a department, her goal is to build a  solid and strong department for students and faculty to come. <br>
Evelyn Boria-Rivera, talked  about her experience pursuing first a master degree and later going back to  school to get her doctoral degree.  Boria-Rivera  made emphasis that in higher education, especially at the doctoral level, you  need faculty members in the same specific area of your specialization and  research project so they can guide your work. On the same line she suggested  one makes sure that the faculty members that will be working with you on your  research will not leave before you finish your project. <br>
Isabel Porras took a  different approach and explained how working for a year before going to  graduate school help her see another side of her field, Cultural Studies, and  outside of academia. This experience made her see that her goals and  personality fit better in academia and not the industry side of her field.  <br>
Monica Pombo shared  her recent experience of applying to graduate school as well as her decision  process when it came to choosing a program. Unlike the other panelists, Pombo  chose to pursue a graduate program which allows her to work outside of  academia. She advised the audience to consider a variety of programs for  graduate school and avoid having only one option. On her case she always  planned to go to Veterinary School after her bachelor’s degree, but once she  started to do research and work in the lab she realized there were other  program she could pursue in the field of veterinary medicine. <br>
The audience was engaged during the event by  sharing their fears regarding graduate school and also by asking questions for  the question and answer session. The questions ranged from approaching  professors for research opportunities to finding a support system in academia.  A specific question asked was how to explain graduate school to one’s family.  One of the panelists, Evelyn Boria-Rivera, gave the example of using salary  comparisons to show one’s family how graduate school will improve one’s income as  well as intellectual level. <br>
It was an inspiring and uplifting morning with  four powerful professional panelists. </p>

            <p><strong>Teatro Chicana: &quot;A Collective Memoir of the Struggle for Social Justice&quot;</strong>
              </p>
            </p>
            <p><img src="/malcs/media/teatro chicana.gif" alt="teatro chicana" width="144" height="216" hspace="2" align="left">On  the evening of February 11th, 2009, the Campus Chapter of MALCS  brought to UC Davis four exceptional Chicana women who contributed to the book <em>Teatro Chicana: A Collective Memoir and Selected  Plays</em>. Felicitas Nuñez, Laura Garcia, Guadalupe Beltran, and Yolanda Flores  were members of a Chicana collective that formed a political theater group during  the 1970s and 1980s to address the social, gender, and political issues they  confronted as working-class women and as Chicano Movement participants. During  the Chicano Movement, activists, overwhelmingly non-professionals, used theater  and specifically actos (skits) as a tool to raise awareness and consciousness  in working-class communities about social injustices stemming from poverty and  racial discrimination. Chicanas, whose deep involvement in theater during the  70’ s and 80’s is rarely depicted, also raised the issue of feminism. <em>Teatro Chicana </em>highlights the  reminiscences and creative production of seventeen Chicana actor-activists.
              </p>
            </p>
            <p>At Davis, Nuñez, Garcia, Beltran, and Flores read  selected&nbsp;materials from the book and shared their personal stories about  how culture, gender, and politics affected their lives during the social  movements of the 70’s and 80’s. Coming from working class backgrounds, the women  paid tribute to their mothers’ strength through their skits. Reading the poem  that introduces her section of the book, Beltran also shared her struggle with  being a first-generation college student. As a group, the women also commented  on how being in teatro made them the stronger women they are today even though  they are still facing many of the same problems. Their performances included  excerpts from two of their actos, <em>E.T.</em> and <em>Bronca, </em>as well as scenes from <em>Salt of the Earth</em>, a famous movie about  a 1954 mining strike. <em>E.T.</em> touched on the immigrant experience while <em>Bronca</em> highlighted  struggle for gender equality and the empowerment of women. During the  question-and-answer session that followed the performance, these Chicanas spoke  of their opposition to the war in Iraq, their hope for the new president,  Barack Obama, and a need for educational equality and to continue the struggle  for social justice. </p>
            <p><br>
              The presentation greatly impressed students in the audience.  Below are some of their comments on <em>Teatro  Chicana </em>Book Tour Event:  “A  Collective Memoir of the Struggle for Social Justice.”</p>
            <p><br>
              “The women in this group are true heroes, fighting for  social equality.”</p>
            <p><br>
              “I enjoyed their skits and their upfront honesty.”</p>
            <p><br>
              “<em>Bronca </em>was a good  finishing skit…they repeated their feminists’ beliefs and what it meant for a  woman to stand up and fight the submissive stereotype. My favorite line from  the song [is] ‘women are now armed, armed with knowledge.’”</p>
            <p><br>
              “<em>Teatro Chicana</em> …emphasize the importance of education and the universal recognition of  rights.”</p>
            <p><br>
              “I found this group  of women to be very admirable for many reasons beyond their noteworthy creation  of <em>Teatro Chicana</em>. I thought they  were very brave… they stressed that the point was not to be good at acting and  singing but to focus on the message behind the skits. They wanted women’s  rights, but also general equality for everyone.”</p>
            <p><br>
              “The most interesting part of these women’s lives is the way  they expressed their views on the political and gender issues of the time.”</p>
            <p><br>
              “I … admired each of  these women’s strength to express the views they knew were right and to  continue their plays…I love how they expressed their views through plays and  not through violence….”</p>
            <p><br>
              “There was so much  background and history that I was never aware, and it was good… to learn.”</p>
            <p><br>
              “When these women told their stories I was not only amazed  by their bravery, but also by their determination to have done <em>Teatro Chicana</em> and completed a book.”</p>
            <p><br>
              “I hope these women continue to inspire the younger  generations as we continue to benefit from their victories, learn from their  mistakes, and embrace our dignity as human beings.”</p>

       	  <p><strong>Plática with Prof. Zoila Mendoza</strong></p>
       	  <p><img src="/malcs/media/Zoila'sBook.jpg" alt="zoila'sbook" width="186" height="304" hspace="2" align="left">MALCS UCD campus chapter kicked off their quarterly “Plática”  series in Winter 2009 with Professor Zoila Mendoza of the Native American Studies  Department. Professor Mendoza’s earned both an M.A. and Ph.D. in Anthropology from  the University of Chicago. Her research involves performance in relation to  ethnic racial identity in Peru. She has published various books and articles  including her recent book <em>Creating Our  Own: Folklore, Performance, and Identity in Cuzco, Peru. </em><br>
       	    In this plática, Prof. Mendoza gave the attendees a little  review of her life and how she came to the field of Anthropology. She grew up  in Lima, Peru and whenever she traveled to the Andes coast, she was fascinated  by the traditions and performances of this region. This fascination for  performance drove her to major in Anthropology and later to pursue graduate  degrees in the field. <br>
       	    She also offered advice on approaching graduate education. First,  she suggested that graduate school should be mold to one’s self interest one it  comes to choosing a program.  Once you  have a program in mind, estab<img src="/malcs/media/zoila-mendoza1.jpg" alt="zoila-mendoza" width="198" height="152" align="right">lish contact with a professor that works in the  area you are interested in.  Often,  contact with a professor in the department will help a student’s application  stand out, since it demonstrates interest in that <em>particular</em> department, and establishes the importance of working  with specific individuals. <br>
       	    The last part of the plática was dedicated to a discussion  of methodologies in Anthropology, as well as commentary on shifts in research  done within the discipline. Whereas older anthropological analyses emphasized “objectivity”  and assumed that one cannot study their own culture, Professor Mendoza  explained the paradigm shift in this and other academic fields that argues  against “objectivity” and urges so-called “insiders” to research their  communities. As Professor Mendoza’s research makes clear, engaged scholarship  in our communities is useful, necessary, and represents a significant shift in  anthropological studies of Latin American indigenous communities. <br>

       	  HIA Conference Room</p>
       	  <strong>Gender and Sexuality Plática</strong></p>
       	  <p><img src="/malcs/media/gender n sexuality platica.JPG" alt="gender n sexuality" width="205" height="174" hspace="3" align="left">To close the fall quarter for  the 2008-2009 school year, MALCS UCD campus chapter featured a Gender and  Sexuality platica with Sonia Montoya from the Women’s Resources and Research  Center (WRRC) and Angie Cazares from the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender  Resource Center (LGBTRC) on Friday, December 5th, 2008. The goal of  this platica was to raise awareness and consciousness about issues affecting  the queer community, focusing on the perspective of Chicana, Latina and Indigenous  women on campus. <br>
       	    The plática started with  brief explanations and definitions of commonly used terms homosexual, lesbian,  gay, bisexual and transgender while also discussing terms such as pansexual,  monosexual and two-spirit. Once the terms were defined and the attendees had an  opportunity to discuss them and raise questions about the terms, Sonia and  Angie performed a skit showing the reaction some people have toward the LGBT  community. <br>
       	    They portrayed two friends  chatting happily until one mentions she is dating someone and clarifies that her  partner is another woman. After the skit, Angie and Sonia moderated an exercise  in which the attendees analyzed the reaction of the characters in the skit and were  asked to think of how we could change the attitudes of the characters to avoid  the uncomfortable moment and the abrupt end of the conversation.<br>
       	    <img src="/malcs/media/WRRC logo.JPG" alt="wrrc" width="208" height="91" hspace="3" align="left">The attendees also shared  some of their experiences dealing with stereotypes toward the LGBT community.  There were also questions throughout the plática to clarify any doubts or to  simply know how to be considerate of members of the queer community. One of the  questions was regarding what to do when a friend comes out to you. Sonia<img src="/malcs/media/lgbtrc logo.JPG" alt="lgbtrc" width="133" height="109" align="right"> and  Angie mentioned that it is vital to support your friend and help them get in  contact with a LGBT resource center. These centers have specialized people that  have the tools to help your friend.<br>
   	      In a final note Sonia and  Angie reminded everyone that the doors of the WRRC and LGBTRC are always open.  Students are welcome and the centers provide a safe space for them. </p>

       	  </p>
       	  <p>MALCS November’s plática featured Prof. Jennifer Chacon  from Law school. Prof. Chacón shared her <a><img src="/images_content/J. Chacon platica 1.JPG" alt="Jennifer Chacon Platica" width="170" height="149" align="right"  class="left
        talign"></a>experience in Law School, her projects  and work experience. Also, the attendees had the opportunity to ask her aboutLaw Schooland higher education in general. Professor Chacon also gave some advice about applying to graduate school, like personalizing personal  statements, studying ahead of time for the placement <img src="/images_content/J. Chacon platica 2.JPG" alt="jenniferplatica" width="228" height="124" hspace="2" align="left">exams (LSAT, GRE, and MCAT)  and applying to the university you actually want to be in. She also gave an  idea of how students are selected for graduate school and how grades are not  all that it counts.  <br>
In a final note she talked about her work on immigration  issues.  She was the lead convener of Obama's campaign advisory  committee on immigration. This committee started with 8 to 12 people and grew  to 80, with Jennifer being the lead person throughout the campaign.<br>
