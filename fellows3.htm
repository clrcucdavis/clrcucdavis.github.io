        <h3><img src="/image_content 2/Evelyn Boria-Rivera" alt="Evelyn Boria-Rivera" width="142" height="168" class="rightalign">2008-2009 </h3>
        <h4>Evelyn Boria-Rivera</h4>
        <p>University of Notre Dame<br>
          English Department</p>
        <p>Boria-Rivera is a Ph.D Candidate in the English Department and Institute for Latino Studies at the University of Notre Dame. Her dissertation considers the role of literary representations of the maternal in the development of late XX century American literature by Latinas and focuses on the historical conciousness of policed maternity, particularly in relation to controlled fertility during the period of the Cold War.Boria-Rivera's project seeks to understand why important histories of maternal repression are almost absent from literary texts that often try to recover and retell the history of major waves of Latin American immigration to the US at the period of the Cold War.</p>

        <h3><img src="images_content/christi_grandluxcafe_thmb.jpg" width="145" height="184" alt="Christina Mendoza" class="rightalign">2007-2008</h3>
        <h4>Christina Mendoza</h4>
        <p>University of Michigan<br>
        Sociology Department</p>

        <p>Christina Mendoza is a Ph.D Candidate in the department of Sociology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Her dissertation explores the temporary migration of Mexican women workers who reside in Mexican border cities and across international borders daily to work as domestics in American homes. Based on in-depth interviews and participant observation with domestic  workers and employers, she analyzes the multiple factors in both Mexico and the United States  that lead to this female "migration" at the border, the influence of gender in this cross-border movement, and the interlocking systems of gender, social class, and race that shape experiences of Mexicana domestic and Chicana employers in the Texas-Mexico border.</p>

        <h3><img src="/images_content/photo_lourdesalberto.jpg" alt="Lourdes Alberto" width="145" class="rightalign">2006-2007 </h3>
        <h4>Lourdes Alberto</h4>
        <p>Rice University<br>
        English Department</p>
        <p>Alberto’s dissertation “The Politics of Articulation: Chicana, Latina, and Indigenous Cultural Productions and U.S. Consumerism, 1973-2001” examines cultural productions of and by Chicana, Latina, and indigenous Mexican women in popular culture to theorize the ways women are deployed to negotiate anxieties around citizenship, inter-ethnic difference and consumerism at the end of the millennium.  Taking popular culture as the central site in which to examine the construction of ethnic identity, Alberto interrogates the indigenous-Chicana-consumer nexus to assert that at the intersection of Chicana cultural productions and Latina consumer culture, indigenous subjects are simultaneously recast as authentic and yet invisible.  This project is the first to vigorously interrogate indigenous identity in the U.S. and the importance of consumer culture in shaping contemporary Mexican American identity.</p>

        <h3>2005-2006 </h3>
        <h4>Melissa Moreno</h4>
        <p>University of Utah<br>
        Department of Education, Culture &amp; Society</p>

        <p>Moreno is a Ph.D Candidate in the Education, Culture &amp; Society Program at the University of Utah. Moreno's dissertation, grounded in ethnographic research, focuses on formations of cultural citizenship practices and identity among young adults who self-identify with U.S.-Mexican communities. By drawing on a combination of post-structural and social cultural theories, she studies how young adults learn to constitute a cultural sense of citizenship in multiple social fields (i.e., family, community, and paid work). In Spring 2005, Moreno will teach an undergraduate course through the Chicana/o Studies Program “Cultural Citizenship and U.S. Mexican Communities.”</p>

        <p>Current: Moreno is currently a Dissertation Fellow in the Department of International and Multicultural Education at the University of San Francisco. She has published in Qualitative Studies in Education, Journal of Latinos and Education and has a forthcoming article in How and Why Gloria Evangelina Anzaldua’s Life and Work Transformed our Own.</p>

        Department of Education, Culture &amp; Society</p>

        <p>DeLaRosa is a Ph.D Candidate in the Education, Culture &amp; Society Program at the University of Utah. Her dissertation provides an institutional profile of Chicana/Latina High School students enrolled in Spanish for Native Speakers Classes and the influence of language use on identity constructions. By focusing on the factors that influence identity, her work contributes to the theoretical discussions about Latina/o identities, school performance and native language use in academic settings. In Spring 2005, while in-residence at UC Davis, DeLaRosa taught her own seminar, “Chicanas/os In Education.” DeLaRosa was a vital contributor to the establishment of the UC Davis MALCS campus chapter, and she also organized, guided and prepared a panel of undergraduates and graduate students to present their work at the annual MALCS Summer Institute held at UC Berkeley, in August 2005.</p>

        <h3><img src="images_content/ines.jpg" width="145" height="170" alt="Ines" class="rightalign">2003-2004</h3>

While in residence at UC Davis Casillas taught her own undergraduate seminar, “Latinidad: The History of Media Making of US Latinos,” through Chicana/o Studies. Casillas also organized “Chicana/Latina Graduate/Undergraduate Roundtable” on May 24, 2004. The workshop encouraged undergraduate women to pursue post-graduate studies higher education through an informal forum for undergraduates to dialogue with current graduate students. Not only did the workshop allow undergraduates to ask faculty questions regarding the “routes” to graduate school from choosing a program, department, and school to the application process itself, graduate students shared their own personal fears, challenges, and triumphs.</p>

        <p>Current: Ines Casillas is currently a 2006-2007 UC President’s Postdoctoral Fellow housed at UC Santa Cruz and will begin an Assistant Professorship for Chicana/o Studies at UC Santa Barbara in July 2007.</p>
